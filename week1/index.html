        <p>I'm an employee at Safaricom with an an avid passion for programming. I believe IT has a big role to play in shaping the outcome of things given
        that we are living in the information age. Most of the problems our country faces can be solved through well engineered information systems
        . This is the reason for me signing up for this course. So that I may acquire thid new skill and use it to make programs that make people's lives better.
        It is currently really difficult to get a credible programmer who would see a project through from analysis and design to go live hence the reason for me trying this out. </p>
