        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I'm an employee at Safaricom with an an avid passion for programming. I believe IT has a big role to play in shaping the outcome of things in
            our country given that we are living in the <span class="important">information age</span>. Most of the problems our country faces can be solved through well engineered information systems
        . This is the reason for me signing up for this course. So that I may acquire thid new skill and use it to make programs that make people's lives better.
        It is currently really difficult to get a credible programmer who would see a project through from analysis and design to go live hence the reason for me trying this out. </p>
